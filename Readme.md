#Finacial Information Manager

##Purpose

Designed to be an easily usable and intuitive display of finaical Information for me and my family.

##Design
Currently the design requiers the set up of excel spreedsheets in a specific way. In the future I hope to move away from this to a more robust but also most likly more complicated thus also requiering a UI for a more Intuative experiance. Below are displayed setups for each of the required spreedsheets.

###Workbooks

###Income sheet

###Budget sheet

##Emailing
